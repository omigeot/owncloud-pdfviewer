This is a very basic PDF viewer for Owncloud. It's heavily based on Mozilla's PDF.js.

In its current form, it just opens PDF.js default viewer on a new page/tab when a PDF is clicked.

To install, just unzip/pull the whole thing into /owncloud/apps/files_pdfviewer/ and that should be it. Oh, yeah, you might have to enable it in Owncloud's admin page.

Regarding License issues, since it's mostly PDF.js, I'd stick to their license (MPL) for now. If grown interesting enough, my own parts would probably become AGPL.

For now, the most important (!) change is just converting the file URL to Base64 and back when passing to viewer.html. Escaping woes...
